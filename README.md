# Unity-Mando

My first unity project in C# for school I was only three weeks old I chose to make an rpg.


## Description of my project

I had to work a lot to be able to understand the unity interface for the project.
I tried to be organized in my files. Unfortunately the code is not optimized.
Many things have been seen such as prefabs, playerprefs, quest mechanisms, triggers, collider etc.
It was very enriching for me in terms of learning and understanding
